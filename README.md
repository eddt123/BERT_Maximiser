# BERT_Maximiser
Takes sentences and calculates the BERT score between them, it then modifies them until they have a maximised BERT score so they are semantically different. 

Include a folder named 'data' with a list of text files that contain the sentences you want to maximise the difference between. 
The modified sentences will be placed in the 'processed_data' folder.
